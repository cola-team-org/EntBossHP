## Installation

3. Place the plugin files in your CounterStrikeSharp plugins directory.
4. Restart the server or load the plugin.

## Configuration

### Per-Map Configuration

The plugin creates configuration files for each map in JSON format:

```text
configs/plugins/EntBossHP/{mapname}.jsonc
```

### Config File Structure

```json
{
  "Breakable": [
    {
      "name": "Boss Name",
      "enabled": true,
      "breakable": "entity_name",
      "health_segment_counter": "counter_name",
      "health_segment_counter_mode": 1,
      "hp_offset": 0
    }
  ],
  "MathCounter": [
    {
      "name": "Math Boss",
      "enabled": true,
      "mathcounter": "counter_name",
      "mathcounter_mode": 1,
      "health_segment_counter": "segment_counter",
      "health_segment_counter_mode": 1,
      "hp_offset": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** The old HPBar configuration block is **deprecated**. Please use MathCounter in combination with health_segment_counter for multi-phase/segmented bosses instead.
